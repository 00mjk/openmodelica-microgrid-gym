# OpenModelica Microgrid Gym (OMG)
![](docs/pictures/microgrid.jpg)


__The OpenModelica Microgrid Gym (OMG) package is a software toolbox for the
simulation and control optimization of microgrids based on energy conversion by power electronic converters.__ 

The main characteristics of the toolbox are the plug-and-play grid design and simulation in OpenModelica as well as the ready-to-go approach of intuitive reinfrocement learning (RL) approaches through a Python interface. 

The OMG toolbox is built upon the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment definition framework. 
Therefore, the toolbox is specifically designed for running reinforcement 
learning algorithms to train agents controlling power electronic converters in microgrids. Nevertheless, also arbritary classical control approaches can be combined and tested using the OMG interface.

A more detailled description of the project is presented in the [user guide](/user_guide/user_guide.html)
